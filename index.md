I am a final year Dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) student in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](http:\\www.me.iitb.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in). I am being advised by [Prof. Debasish Chatterjee](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~chatterjee) and [Prof. Ravi Banavar](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~banavar) in the [Department of Systems and Control Engineering](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in). 

My research currently focuses on various mathematical aspects of optimization and control.

Report I prepared as part of a course project. Contains a review of the contents of  The objective of the report is to show that the Newmark
family of time integration algorithms, used widely in the computational structural dynamics community, is
variational in nature. Contains a very compressed and slightly modified exposition of the contents of [MaWe2001](http://lagrange.mechse.illinois.edu/pubs/MaWe2001/) and [KaMaOrWe2000](http://lagrange.mechse.illinois.edu/pubs/KaMaOrWe2000/).
